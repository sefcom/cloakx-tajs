/**
 * TAJS Inspector is a web-based interface to display TAJS analysis results. It is primarily intended as a development tool for investigating information collected during analysis. This includes abstract values of variables and properties, call graphs, and type warnings, but also internal analysis information, such as, number of times each primitive instruction is processed, number of contexts for each function, and "imprecision suspiciousness" of abstract states.
